                    <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, allows web users to create and structure sections, paragraphs, and links using elements, tags, and attributes. However, it’s worth noting that HTML is not considered a programming language as it can’t create dynamic functionality.</p>
                    <p>HTML has a lot of use cases, namely :</p>
                    <p>1. Web development. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files. </p>
                    <p>2. Internet navigation. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks. </p>
                    <p>3. Web documentation. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.</p>
                    <p>It’s also worth noting that HTML is now considered an official web standard. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) maintains and develops HTML specifications, along with providing regular updates. </p>

                    <p>What is CSS?</p>
                    <img src="img/maxresdefaultCSS.jpg" alt="" class="mt-1 mb-3 modal-img">
                    <p>CSS stands for cascading style sheets, according to Techterms, CSS can be interpreted as a tiered sheet for web page layout formats. CSS is an invention to help web developers who previously only depended on HTML as a markup language. HTML was originally used to mark objects on web pages such as tables, images, paragraphs, and so on.</p>
                    <P>CSS emerged and became known as a tool for formatting documents written using a markup language, namely HTML. CSS is also known as a style sheet language that works with HTML to build a web page.</P>
                    <p>So, in general we can interpret HTML as a language to describe the structure of web pages, while CSS is a language to describe web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. This allows a developer to adapt presentations to various types of devices, such as large screen monitors, small screen tablets or smartphones, to printers. CSS no longer relies on HTML and can be used with other markup languages.</p>
                    <p>How CSS Works</p>
                    <img src="img/sta-je-css.png" alt="" class="mt-1 mb-3 modal-img">
                    <p>CSS works when a browser displays a document, that's why at that time the browser had to combine the document content with the information style or presentation style in the pages of a site. To build a web page and make its presentation as attractive as possible, CSS has several working steps which can be described as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. Load HTML, in this stage the browser loads HTML from the network</p>
                    <p>2. Parse HTML, at this stage parsing HTML occurs to create a document object model (DOM) and load CSS. DOM acts to represent documents in computer memory. The DOM has a tree-like structure and includes elements, attributes, chunks of text in the markup language that are nodes or the DOM tree structure. The DOM can help developers design, debug, and maintain CSS because the DOM is the place where CSS and document content meet.</p>
                    <p>3. Load CSS, the browser or browser then loads most of the resources that the HTML document will link to, such as embedded images or videos. In this case the CSS is then loaded and linked.</p>
                    <p>4. Parse CSS, just like HTML, CSS is then parsed by sorting different rules based on their selector type into different buckets such as elements, classes, IDs, and so on. This selection determines which rules should be applied to the DOM nodes.</p>
                    <p>5. Render tree, the selection in each CSS element that will be applied to the DOM node as needed is called the render tree. This rendering tree is laid out in the structure that should appear after the node and element rules and adjustments have been applied.</p>
                    <p>6. Display, after the adjustment has been carried out and the rules are executed, the CSS and DOM will form a visual display of a web page that is displayed on the screen.</p>
                    <p>CSS Functions</p>
                    <p>The CSS functions are as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. Loading web pages quickly, the role of CSS in simplifying HTML work makes the coding process shorter so this affects the implementation of the document and the process of calling it. The process of opening web pages and downloading documents from the site will run faster than the presence of HTML tag attributes in each document.</p>
                    <p>2. Designs are processed quickly, the use of CSS to work on web page designs has been proven to speed up the process of building a web page. This is due to the division of labor between HTML which plays a role in building web structures and CSS with its role focused on web design. The existence of CSS functions can allow developers to implement a single document that can appear on multiple web pages without repeated code copying.</p>
                    <p>3. Adaptive to various devices, the CSS function that has been mentioned previously is to make page content adaptive or compatible with various devices or browsers with different sizes and versions. CSS allows a document to be opened in the latest and older versions of the device, as well as the browser version the user is using.</p>

                    <p>What Is Bootstrap?</p>
                    <img src="img/BStrap.webp" alt="" class="mt-1 mb-3 modal-img">
                    <p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source web development framework. It’s designed to ease the web development process of responsive, mobile-first websites by providing a collection of syntax for template designs.</p>
                    <p>In other words, Bootstrap helps web developers build websites faster as they don’t need to worry about basic commands and functions. It consists of HTML, CSS, and JS-based scripts for various web design-related functions and components.</p>
                    <p>Basic Functions of Bootstrap</p>
                    <img src="img/bootstrap-icons.png" alt="" class="mt-1 mb-3 modal-img">
                    <p>The main function of Bootstrap is to create responsive sites. The website interface will work optimally on all screen sizes, both on smartphone screens and computer/laptop screens. Developers no longer need to design specific sites for certain devices.</p>
                    <p>Bootstrap Advantages</p>
                    <p>After knowing what bootstrap is and also its function for websites, now you also have to know what are the advantages of using this bootstrap. for those of you who want to use it, here are some of the advantages it offers:</p>
                    <P>1. More time efficient, bootstrap itself provides a lot of libraries containing various kinds of ready-made scripts for programmers to use when developing front-end websites. So that the developers no longer make time to write various SCC scripts from scratch.</P>
                    <p>2. More flexible, the use of bootstrap websites also makes the work of developers and programmers more flexible. Yes, because the frame can indeed be used as desired and freely. You can more easily modify the various scripts that are already in it. There are no special conditions to take advantage of this bootstrap.</p>
                    <p>3. Design oriented, bootstrap for website purposes generally has a very good standard system, this system is called the grid system name. Grid is a two-dimensional structure that is a combination of vertical and horizontal axes that form columns and rows. The columns and rows then represent the dimensions that are already available in a browser.</p>
                    <p>4. LESS is More, this is something that is very popular among programmers as well as web developers for some reason. The reason for this is related to the responsive function that bootstrap itself has. By using this bootstrap website that you have is also more responsive and can be displayed for all websites properly.</p>
